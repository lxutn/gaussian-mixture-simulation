This repository contains  simulation codes for the paper "Xu, L., Y. Mo, and L. Xie, Remote State Estimation with Stochastic Event-triggered Sensor Schedule in the Presence of Packet Drops. submitted, 2019".

- The "estiamtors.py" file contains all estimators written in python functions.

- The "RelativeMSEvsLossRate.py" file compares the relative MSE of different estimators w.r.t. different packet loss rate.

- The "ExecutionTimeCompare.py" file compares the execution time of different estimators.

- The "RelativeMSEPlot.m" and "ExecutionTimePlot.m" are MATLAB scripts to plot the final simulation result.
